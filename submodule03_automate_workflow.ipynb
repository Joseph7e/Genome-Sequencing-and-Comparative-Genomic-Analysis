    "# Submodule 3: Workflow automation with Nextflow and aquisition of public datasets\n",
    "--------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this submodule is to **generate multiple genome datasets** that will be used in the subsequent submodule on comparative genomics. This will be a short submodule in terms of content, but it is the most computationally intensive submodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will **automate the processes outlined in Submodules 1 & 2** using **Nextflow**, a workflow management platform designed to streamline and ensure reproducibility in bioinformatics pipelines. Nextflow allows us to automate the entire workflow, including program version control, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating parallel execution of multiple datasets. This enables us to efficiently run many genome datasets simultaneously, while managing the computational resources available in our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the Nextflow workflow on our set of genomes, we will supplement our data with **reference-quality genome sequences from NCBI** in **Submodule 4**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- **Learn Reproducibility in Bioinformatics**:  \n",
    "  Understand the importance of reproducibility in bioinformatics workflows and learn how to implement practices that ensure consistent, reliable results across different systems and environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate Genome Data Processing**:  \n",
    "  Learn how to automate and streamline the processes of genome assembly, quality control, and annotation to handle multiple genome datasets efficiently using the workflow management platform **Nextflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execute Parallel Processing and Ensure Data Integrity**:  \n",
    "  Gain proficiency in managing and processing large sets of genomic data simultaneously, while also developing the ability to monitor, assess, and maintain data integrity and quality throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prepare and Refine Genome Sequences for Comparative Genomics**:  \n",
    "  Refine and prepare a collection of genome datasets, ensuring they are processed, cleaned, and ready for detailed examination in comparative genomics."

    "## The Importance of Reproducibility in Bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, particularly in bioinformatics, where computational analyses of biological data play a significant role in advancing our understanding of genomics, disease, and evolution. In bioinformatics, ensuring that analyses can be repeated with the same results is critical for validating findings and building trust within the scientific community. This is especially important given the large datasets and complex analyses often involved, where slight variations in workflows, software versions, or data can lead to different outcomes. Reproducible research ensures that experiments can be independently verified, improving the credibility of results and facilitating the development of robust, evidence-based conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support reproducibility in bioinformatics, many workflows are built using standardized, transparent tools and platforms, such as **Nextflow**, **Snakemake**, and **Galaxy**, which allow scientists to document and automate every step of their analysis. This makes it possible for others to re-run the same pipeline on their own systems, using the same parameters and input data, thus ensuring consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FAIR Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The FAIR principles are guidelines designed to enhance the visibility and accessibility of research data. FAIR stands for **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**. These principles aim to make scientific data easier to find, use, and share, which is especially important in bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Findable**: Data should be easy to locate through searchable metadata, unique identifiers, and standardized naming conventions.\n",
    "- **Accessible**: Data should be available in formats that are easy to access and retrieve, even if only through proper authentication or permissions.\n",
    "- **Interoperable**: Data and tools should be compatible, allowing for the exchange of information across systems, platforms, and communities.\n",
    "- **Reusable**: Data should be well-documented, with clear descriptions of methods, metadata, and usage licenses, so others can confidently reuse it in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools  to Aid in Reproducability in Bioinformatics\n",
    "To ensure reproducibility in bioinformatics workflows, several tools and platforms are available that help automate, document, and track the analysis process. These tools facilitate consistent execution of pipelines, improve collaboration, and ensure that results can be verified and reproduced across different environments and systems.\n",

The study includes sequencing read datasets for 528 isolates of Campylobacter spp. (452 C. jejuni and 76 C. coli) from human (494), food (21), and environmental (2) sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a robust comparative genomic analysis, it is essential to include a balanced and statistically sufficient sample size for each species. A minimum of 50-100 isolates per species is recommended to capture population-level variability, with larger sample sizes (e.g., 100-200) providing greater statistical power to detect subtle genomic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use a small subset of ~10 isolates to ensure analyses run quickly. However, the methods presented here are fully scalable and can be applied to larger datasets like those described in the manuscript. This smaller subset of sequencing data is derived from Table 2. of the manuscript.\n",

    "Next we will run a bash command that initiates the Nextflow workflow on a directory containing raw FASTQ files. Each of these paired FASTQ files represents the sequencing data genearted from unique isolates. We begin by listing the contents of the directory and then proceed with executing the Nextflow workflow. This workflow automates all the steps from Submodules 1 and 2, ensuring a seamless process. Nextflow intelligently determines which steps can be executed concurrently (e.g., BLAST and BWA read mapping) and which steps require prior completion of others (e.g., running BlobTools after BLAST and related processes finish).\n",

In this step of the workflow, we trim paired-end sequencing reads using **FASTP**. The `RUN_FASTP` process takes paired-end reads as input and outputs the trimmed versions of the reads. Here's the Nextflow code to perform this task:\n",
