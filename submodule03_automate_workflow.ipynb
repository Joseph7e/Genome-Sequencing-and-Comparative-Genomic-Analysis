    "# Submodule 3: Workflow automation with Nextflow and aquisition of public datasets\n",
    "--------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this submodule is to **generate multiple genome datasets** that will be used in the subsequent submodule on comparative genomics. This will be a short submodule in terms of content, but it is the most computationally intensive submodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will **automate the processes outlined in Submodules 1 & 2** using **Nextflow**, a workflow management platform designed to streamline and ensure reproducibility in bioinformatics pipelines. Nextflow allows us to automate the entire workflow, including program version control, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating parallel execution of multiple datasets. This enables us to efficiently run many genome datasets simultaneously, while managing the computational resources available in our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the Nextflow workflow on our set of genomes, we will supplement our data with **reference-quality genome sequences from NCBI** in **Submodule 4**.\n",

    "## The Importance of Reproducibility in Bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, particularly in bioinformatics, where computational analyses of biological data play a significant role in advancing our understanding of genomics, disease, and evolution. In bioinformatics, ensuring that analyses can be repeated with the same results is critical for validating findings and building trust within the scientific community. This is especially important given the large datasets and complex analyses often involved, where slight variations in workflows, software versions, or data can lead to different outcomes. Reproducible research ensures that experiments can be independently verified, improving the credibility of results and facilitating the development of robust, evidence-based conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support reproducibility in bioinformatics, many workflows are built using standardized, transparent tools and platforms, such as **Nextflow**, **Snakemake**, and **Galaxy**, which allow scientists to document and automate every step of their analysis. This makes it possible for others to re-run the same pipeline on their own systems, using the same parameters and input data, thus ensuring consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FAIR Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The FAIR principles are guidelines designed to enhance the visibility and accessibility of research data, particularly in bioinformatics. FAIR stands for **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**. These principles aim to make scientific data easier to find, use, and share, which is especially important in bioinformatics, where data often comes from multiple sources and is essential for advancing knowledge in genetics, medicine, and ecology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Findable**: Data should be easy to locate through searchable metadata, unique identifiers, and standardized naming conventions.\n",
    "- **Accessible**: Data should be available in formats that are easy to access and retrieve, even if only through proper authentication or permissions.\n",
    "- **Interoperable**: Data and tools should be compatible, allowing for the exchange of information across systems, platforms, and communities.\n",
    "- **Reusable**: Data should be well-documented, with clear descriptions of methods, metadata, and usage licenses, so others can confidently reuse it in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adhering to the FAIR principles enhances collaboration, promotes transparency, and ensures that bioinformatics data can be effectively utilized by researchers across disciplines, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools  to Aid in Reproducability in Bioinformatics\n",
    "To ensure reproducibility in bioinformatics workflows, several tools and platforms are available that help automate, document, and track the analysis process. These tools facilitate consistent execution of pipelines, improve collaboration, and ensure that results can be verified and reproduced across different environments and systems.\n",

Each of these paired FASTQ files represents the sequencing data genearted from unique isolates. We begin by listing the contents of the directory and then proceed with executing the Nextflow workflow. This workflow automates all the steps from Submodules 1 and 2, ensuring a seamless process. Nextflow intelligently determines which steps can be executed concurrently (e.g., BLAST and BWA read mapping) and which steps require prior completion of others (e.g., running BlobTools after BLAST and related processes finish).\n",

For the sake of time most outputs were pre-prepared and only the summaries and finalization should have run. The main output is a directy of proteomes and a report file. We also saved select files from processes throughout the workflow (blobtools plots etc.). Lets view these files."
