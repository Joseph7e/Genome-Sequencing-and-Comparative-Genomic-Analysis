    "--------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomics is the comprehensive study of an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. It provides a deep understanding of the genetic blueprint that governs the biology, function, and behavior of organisms. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, genomics has become an essential tool for exploring the genetic basis of health and disease, understanding evolution, and studying biodiversity. A critical component of genomics is genome assembly, which involves reconstructing the genome of an organism from short DNA sequences generated by sequencing technologies. Genome assembly is a foundational step that allows researchers to generate a complete picture of the genetic material in a given organism. Assessing the quality and completeness of a genome assembly ensures that it accurately reflects the original genome, providing a reliable foundation for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative genomics builds on genome assembly by comparing the genomes of different species or individuals. This field focuses on identifying similarities and differences in DNA sequences to understand evolutionary relationships, discover conserved genetic elements, and reveal the genetic underpinnings of adaptation and diversity. Comparative genomics can uncover how species evolve and adapt over time and identify genes associated with specific traits or diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the key concepts and methodologies in genomics, including how to assemble a genome, how to assess its quality, how to annotate the genome, and how to perform comparative analyses.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Acquire the skills to assemble raw sequencing reads into a draft genome, assess the quality of the genome assembly, and annotate the genome sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Learn to perform comparative genomic analyses to identify similarities and differences across genomes, run phylogenomic analyses, construct pangenomes to capture genetic diversity, and apply these techniques to address biological questions and hypotheses. "

    "### What is Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput method that allows for rapid sequencing of DNA. Illumina remains the most widely used sequenicng platform. It is accurate, inexpensive, and fast, providing up to 540 Gb of data on a single flow cell in about a 1-2 days. Other long-read sequencing technologies (i.e. PacBio and Nanopore) are becoming widely used in the research community, and will be discussed in later modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1, outlines the basic workflow for sequencing a microbial genome. It begins with the **isolation of bacterial cultures**, which involves culturing bacteria from a sample on selective media to obtain a pure strain. Once a pure culture is established, **DNA extraction** is performed to isolate the genomic DNA from the bacterial cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Illumina-based sequencing the DNA is **fragmented** into smaller pieces and attached to specially coated surfaces, creating a dense cluster of identical fragments. Through a process called **sequencing by synthesis**, fluorescently labeled nucleotides are incorporated one at a time into these clusters. Each incorporated nucleotide emits a distinct signal, allowing the sequencer to determine the DNA sequence in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology enables millions of fragments to be sequenced simultaneously, significantly increasing throughput and reducing costs.\n",

    "### De Bruijn Graphs in Genome Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "A **de Bruijn graph** is a structure used in genome assembly to represent sequences using **k-mers**. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **K-mers**: These are short sequences of length *k* derived from a longer DNA sequence. For example, from the sequence \"AGCT\", the 2-mers are \"AG\", \"GC\", and \"CT\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Construction**: Each k-mer becomes a vertex in the graph. An edge is drawn from k-mer **A** to k-mer **B** if the last *k-1* nucleotides of **A** match the first *k-1* nucleotides of **B**. This creates a directed graph where paths through the vertices represent potential sequences in the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contigs and Scaffolds**:\n",
    "   - **Contigs**: These are contiguous sequences formed by traversing paths in the graph.\n",
    "   - **Scaffolds**: Longer constructs that may combine multiple contigs, providing additional structure to the genome assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "De Bruijn graphs enable efficient handling of sequencing data, especially for complex genomes with repetitive sequences.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Key challenges for genome assembly:\n",
    "**<u>Intrinsic Challenges:</u>**\n",
    "1. **Heterozygosity:** The alleles of a gene are not he same, yet we force them into a single consensus sequence.\n",
    "2. **Paralogy vs. Alleleism**: Genes come from other genes by a process of duplication. This results in two or more similar genes in an organism. There are two alleles in a diploid organism that are very similiar. How do you tell a duplicated gene from alleles of a gene?\n",
    "3. **Sequence complexity**: Simple sequence repeats (SSR), large scale repeats like transposable elements (TEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Extrinsic Challenges:</u>**\n",
    "1. **Quality of DNA sequences (sequencing errors):** Each sequencing technology has specific patterns of error.\n",
    "2. **Length of DNA sequence reads**: Shorter reads are less likely to be unique or to include unique K-mers (see below).\n",
    "3. **Coverage**: Depth of coverage is a random process at best. Consequently some regions of the genome will have low levels of coverage.\n",
    "4. **Memory intensive**: Inherently requires large amounts of RAM for assebly and storage of input and output.\n",
