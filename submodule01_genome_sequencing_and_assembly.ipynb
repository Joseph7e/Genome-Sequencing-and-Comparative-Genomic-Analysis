    "# Submodule 1: Introduction to genome sequencing and assembly\n",
    "--------\n",
    "Genomics is the comprehensive study of an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. It provides a deep understanding of the genetic blueprint that governs the biology, function, and behavior of organisms. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, genomics has become an essential tool for exploring the genetic basis of health and disease, understanding evolution, and studying biodiversity. A critical component of genomics is genome assembly, which involves reconstructing the genome of an organism from short DNA sequences generated by sequencing technologies. Genome assembly is a foundational step that allows researchers to generate a complete picture of the genetic material in a given organism. Assessing the quality and completeness of a genome assembly ensures that it accurately reflects the original genome, providing a reliable foundation for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative genomics builds on genome assembly by comparing the genomes of different species or individuals. This field focuses on identifying similarities and differences in DNA sequences to understand evolutionary relationships, discover conserved genetic elements, and reveal the genetic underpinnings of adaptation and diversity. Comparative genomics can uncover how species evolve and adapt over time and identify genes associated with specific traits or diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the key concepts and methodologies in genomics, including how to assemble a genome, assess its quality, and perform comparative analyses. Through hands-on examples, you will learn how to analyze genomic data, interpret results, and apply various computational tools to gain deeper insights into the genetic information that defines life.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Understand how high throughput sequencing data is generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Develop an understanding of core bioinformatic input/output formats as it relates to comparative genomics. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Acquire the skills to assemble raw sequencing reads into a draft genome, assess the quality of the genome assembly, and annotate the genome sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Learn to perform comparative genomic analyses to identify similarities and differences across genomes, run phylogenomic analyses, construct pangenomes to capture genetic diversity, and apply these techniques to address biological questions and hypotheses. "
