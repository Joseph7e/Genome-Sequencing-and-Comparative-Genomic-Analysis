    "# Submodule 1: Introduction to Genome Sequencing and Assembly\n",
    "--------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Genomics is the comprehensive study of an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. It provides a deep understanding of the genetic blueprint that governs the biology, function, and behavior of organisms. With the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, genomics has become an essential tool for exploring the genetic basis of health and disease, understanding evolution, and studying biodiversity. In this submodule you will learn how DNA and RNA sequencing data is produced and how to reconstruct the genome of an organism from short DNA sequences generated by sequencing technologies. The process will be completed using through an interactive markdown document and will use command-line bioinformatic tools. We will explore the key concepts and methodologies in genomics, including how to assemble a genome, how to assess its quality, how to annotate the genome, and how to perform comparative analyses.\n",

    "## Background: How is sequencing data produced?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput method that allows for rapid sequencing of DNA. Illumina remains the most widely used sequencing platform. It is accurate, inexpensive, and fast, providing up to 540 Gb of data in about a 1-2 days. Other long-read sequencing technologies (i.e. PacBio and Nanopore) are becoming widely used in the research community, and will be discussed in later bioinformatic modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 outlines the basic workflow for sequencing a microbial genome. It begins with the **isolation of bacterial cultures**, which involves culturing bacteria from a sample on selective media to obtain a pure strain. Once a pure culture is established, **DNA extraction** is performed to isolate the genomic DNA from the bacterial cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Illumina-based sequencing, DNA is **fragmented** into smaller pieces, and adapters and barcode indexes are added to each fragment to enable sequencing and sample multiplexing. This step is called **library preparation**. The prepared sequencing libraries are then attached to a specially coated surface on a microscope slide, forming dense clusters of identical DNA fragments ready for sequencing. IN a process called **sequencing by synthesis**, fluorescently labeled nucleotides are incorporated into the clusters one at a time, using the complementary base pairing properties of DNA. Each incorporated nucleotide emits a distinct signal, allowing the sequencer to determine the DNA sequence in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology enables millions of fragments to be sequenced simultaneously, significantly increasing throughput and reducing costs.\n",

It performs several critical tasks, including base correction, adapter trimming, read filtering, and quality score recalibration. Additionally, it provides deduplication to remove PCR duplicates and offers comprehensive quality control through detailed reports and visualizations. Its efficiency allows it to handle large datasets rapidly, making it ideal for processing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in various formats like FASTQ. Alternative tools for similar purposes include **Trimmomatic**, **Cutadapt**, and **FASTX-Toolkit**, which offer some of the same functionalities but may differ in speed, ease of use, and specific features."

    "\n",
    "- **<u>Before filtering</u>**:\n",
    "  - **Read1** and **Read2** both start with 1,591,280 reads, with high overall quality scores. Over 99% of bases have a quality score (Q20) above 20, and about 96% of bases have a quality score (Q30) above 30, indicating good overall quality in the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<u>After filtering</u>**:\n",
    "  - The total number of reads decreases slightly to 1,568,979 for both **Read1** and **Read2**. Despite this reduction, the quality improves, with over 99% of bases achieving Q20 and over 96% of bases achieving Q30 for **Read1**, and over 98% for **Read2**. This shows that filtering removed low-quality reads while maintaining high-quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<u>Filtering summary</u>**:\n",
    "  - A total of 31,379,958 reads passed the quality filter, while 43,808 reads failed due to low quality. A small number (794) failed due to the presence of too many 'N' bases, and no reads were discarded due to being too short.\n",
    "  - **Adapter trimming** removed 5,320,114 bases across both reads, which improves the accuracy of downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<u>Duplication rate</u>**: \n",
    "  - The duplication rate is low at 2.70%, meaning most reads are unique and useful for assembly and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<u>Insert size</u>**: \n",
    "  - The insert size peak is 168, which reflects the typical distance between paired-end reads, providing valuable information about the sequencing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that **fastp** was effective in cleaning the raw sequencing data by removing low-quality reads and trimming adapter sequences, resulting in improved data quality suitable for downstream analyses."

    "### De Bruijn Graphs in Genome Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "A **de Bruijn graph** is a structure used in genome assembly to represent sequences using **k-mers**. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **K-mers**: These are short sequences of length *k* derived from a longer DNA sequence. For example, from the sequence \"AGCT\", the 2-mers are \"AG\", \"GC\", and \"CT\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Construction**: Each k-mer becomes a vertex in the graph. An edge is drawn from k-mer **A** to k-mer **B** if the last *k-1* nucleotides of **A** match the first *k-1* nucleotides of **B**. This creates a directed graph where paths through the vertices represent potential sequences in the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contigs and Scaffolds**:\n",
    "   - **Contigs**: These are contiguous sequences formed by traversing paths in the graph.\n",
    "   - **Scaffolds**: Longer constructs that may combine multiple contigs, providing additional structure to the genome assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "De Bruijn graphs enable efficient handling of sequencing data, especially for complex genomes with repetitive sequences.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Key challenges for genome assembly:\n",
    "**<u>Intrinsic Challenges:</u>**\n",
    "1. **Heterozygosity:** The alleles of a gene are not he same, yet we force them into a single consensus sequence.\n",
    "2. **Paralogy vs. Alleleism**: Genes come from other genes by a process of duplication. This results in two or more similar genes in an organism. There are two alleles in a diploid organism that are very similiar. How do you tell a duplicated gene from alleles of a gene?\n",
    "3. **Sequence complexity**: Simple sequence repeats (SSR), large scale repeats like transposable elements (TEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Extrinsic Challenges:</u>**\n",
    "1. **Quality of DNA sequences (sequencing errors):** Each sequencing technology has specific patterns of error.\n",
    "2. **Length of DNA sequence reads**: Shorter reads are less likely to be unique or to include unique K-mers (see below).\n",
    "3. **Coverage**: Depth of coverage is a random process at best. Consequently some regions of the genome will have low levels of coverage.\n",
    "4. **Memory intensive**: Inherently requires large amounts of RAM for assebly and storage of input and output.\n",
