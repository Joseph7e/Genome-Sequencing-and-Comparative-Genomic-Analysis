    "# Submodule 2: Assessment of genome assembly and genome annotation\n",
    "--------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this submodule, you will begin with the genome that you assembled in Submodule 1. The primary goal of this submodule is to assess the quality of the assembled genome through the lens of what we call the \"5 Cs\": Contiguity, Completeness, Contamination, Coverage, and Content. By utilizing a combination of bioinformatics tools, participants will evaluate the assembled genome and generate outputs that include visualizations, a cleaned genome sequence and functional annotations. These outputs wil will be used in submodule 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "Through this submodule, users will gain hands-on experience in quality assessment, resulting in a deeper understanding of genomic data integrity and the significance of accurate genome sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand and Apply the 5 Cs of Genome Quality**:  \n",
    "  Understand how to assess the overall quality of a genome sequence by examing Contiguity (QUAST), Completeness (BUSCO), Contamination (BLAST/BlobTools), Coverage (BWA/Samtools), and Content (Prokka gene annotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate and Interpret Visualizations**:  \n",
    "  Gain proficiency in using bioinformatics tools and foster skills in data analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relate the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology to Genome Annotation**:  \n",
    "  Connect the principles of the central dogma (DNA → RNA → Protein) to the process of genome annotation, understanding how gene annotations contribute to functional genomics and biological interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Produce a Clean and Annotated Genome**:  \n",
    "  Participants will refine the genome based on their assessments, ensuring a high-quality, annotated genome that can be used for further analysis or research applications."

Fragmented genes are an artifact of the fact that our genome did not assemble perfectly. Some of our genome is fragmented into multiple contigs, and with that some of our genes are going to be fragmented as well. This is why it is important to inspect the N50 of the genome with QUAST. We want the majority of our contigs to be at least as big as a gene, if it's not than we will have many fragmented genes as a result.\n",

    "Read Mapping refers to the process of aligning short reads to a reference sequence. This reference can be a complete genome, a transcriptome, or in our case de novo assembly. Read mapping is fundamental to many commonly used pipelines like differential expression or SNP analysis. We will be using it to calculate the average coverage of each of our contigs and to calculate the overall coverage of our genome (a requirement for genbank submission).The main output of read mapping is a **Sequence Alignment Map format (SAM)**. The file provides information about where our sequencing reads match to our assembly and information about how it maps. There are hundreds of programs that use SAM files as a primary input. A BAM file is the binary version of a SAM, and can be converted very easily using samtools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programs perform read mapping. The recommended program depends on what you are trying to do. My favorite is 'BWA mem' which balances performance and accuracy well. The input to the program is a referece assembly and reads to map (forward and reverse). The output is a SAM file. By default BWA writes the SAM file to standard output, I therefore save it directly to a file. There are lots of options, please see the manual to understand what I am using."

    "The x-axis on these plots is GC content, the y-axis is the coverage (log transformed). The size of the 'blobs' are the length of the contigs. Colors represent taxonomic assignment (the -r option lets you choose which rank to view). The concept of these plots and ultimately for assembly filtering is that each organism has a unique GC content. For example Streptomyces has an average GC content of about 0.72 while other bacteria can go as low as 0.2. In addition, contamination is most likely has much lower coverage compared to the rest of your assembly. Combine that with the taxonomic assignments and you have multiple lines of evidence to identify your non-target contigs. In the plot above you can fairly easily see what contigs we plan to remove."
