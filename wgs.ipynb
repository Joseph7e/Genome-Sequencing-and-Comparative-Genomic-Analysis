    "## General Notes:\n",
    "**For each program that we run in this tutorial I have provided a link to the manual**. These manuals provide a thorough explanation of what exactly we are doing. Before running the program it is a good idea to skim through these, examine the options, and see what it does. It is also a good idea to check out the publication associated with the program. Please note that the commands we run are general and usually executed with default settings. This works great for most genomes but the options may need to be tweaked depending on your genome. Before you run any command it is also a great idea to look at the programs help menu. This can usually be done with the name of the program followed by '-h' or '-help' or '--help'. i.e. 'spades -h'. Also ... never forget about google for quick answers to any confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial the commands you will type are formatted into the gray text boxes (don't do it when learning but they can be faithfully copied and pasted). The '#' symbol indicates a comment, BASH knows to ignore these lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes a general understanding of the BASH environment. **You should be familiar with moving around the directories and understand how to manipulate files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the BASH tutorial and primers to get started. https://github.com/Joseph7e/HCGS-BASH-tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember to tab complete!** There is a reason the tab is my favorite key. It prevents spelling errors and allows you to work much faster. Remember if a filename isn't auto-completing you can hit tab twice to see your files while you continue typing your command. If a file doesn't auto-complete it means you either have a spelling mistake, are in a different directory than you originally thought, or that it doesn't exist.\n",

You may also notice that the fastqc report 'failed' for adapter content. The Trimmomtic program will be used to trim these low quality bases and to remove the adapters. I created a wrapper script called trim_script_TruSeq.sh which makes this program much easier to use. It is available on the server by calling its name, it is also available on this github repository. For this wrapper script **the input is the raw forward and reverse reads and the output will be new trimmed fastq files**. We will use these trimmed reads for our genome assembly.

Read mapping is fundamental to many commonly used pipelines like differential expression or SNP analysis. We will be using it to calculate the average coverage of each of our contigs and to calculate the overall coverage of our genome (a requirement for genbank submission).The main output of read mapping is a Sequence Alignment Map format (SAM). The file provides information about where our sequencing reads match to our assembly and information about how it maps. There are hundreds of programs that use SAM files as a primary input.
